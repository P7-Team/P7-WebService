# P7-WebService

This is the web service of Community Computing (ComCom) which is implemented for the first semester of  the masters in software on AAU.

In the project a  [Client](https://github.com/P7-Team/P7-Client) was also created.

Before the web-service is started it can be configured in the "appsetting.json" file found in the WebService project.
This allows to change the connection string used to connect with the underlying database.
A schema for the database used can be found in "Database/database.sql", with the configurable connection string. This allows a local database instance to be used with the web service.

The webservice is started from the Program class in the WebService project
